  <h3>Enabling search and download of open grants data published using the 360Giving Standard</h3>

  <p>GrantNav is designed to make it easy for people search, explore and download open grant data published using the 360Giving Standard. It makes it possible to find out which organisations have funded which sectors or regions, making it easier to map out the resources that are available and how this may have changed over time. The application displays the details of thousands of grants awarded by a wide range of UK grantmakers which they have made publicly available.</p>

  <p>Some 360Giving Standard open data includes basic information about individuals associated with a grant, such as name, job title and organisation.</p>

  <p>GrantNav is not directly responsible for any of the data on this site. If you see a problem with data on this site this should be reported directly to the relevant organisation. To find out how to contact them, see the "Where is this data from?" section at the bottom of each GrantNav grant page. GrantNav is covered by the 360Giving Take Down policy for requests to remove data that is published to the 360Giving Standard: <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/take-down-policy/">http://www.threesixtygiving.org/take-down-policy/</a></p>
