<h1>Data used in GrantNav</h1>

<p>The data used by GrantNav is open data. GrantNav contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data published to the <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard/">360Giving Standard</a></li>
  <li>Data derived from <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/code-point-open.html">Code-Point Open</a> </li>
  <li>Data derived from <a href="http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/default.aspx">Charity Commission data</a></li>
  <li>Data derived from <a href="https://ons.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cce0999ed17f4fbd9f2f5480997405c5">Northern Ireland Ward to Council Area Lookup</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Data published to the 360Giving Standard is taken from an <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/find-data/">up to date list on the 360Giving website</a>.  The <a href="/datasets/#datasets-used">360Giving Datasets Used table</a> below lists the specific datasets used in GrantNav, how they are licensed, and when they were retrieved.
</p>

<p>We use the <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/code-point-open.html">Code-Point Open</a> data to augment some of the location data.  We use the <a href="http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/default.aspx">Charity Commission data</a> to look up charity names.  Both these datasets are licensed under an <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government License</a>, see <a href="#copyright">Copyright and Attribution</a> below for full details.<p>

<h2>Updates to data in GrantNav</h2>

<p>We update GrantNav on a monthly basis.</p>  

<p>In order for data to be included in any updates of GrantNav, the dataset needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listed on the <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/">360Giving Data Registry</a>;</li> 
<li>Openly licensed;</li>
<li>Valid according to the schema used for 360Giving Standard.</li> 
</ul>

<p>If the dataset meets these three criteria then it will be loaded into GrantNav. We do this by downloading all data listed on the <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/">360Giving Data Registry</a> on the first working day of the month. We then check this updated information is loaded correctly, with the aim of releasing the new version of GrantNav on the tenth working day of each month.</p>

<p>To ensure that any updated or new data is included in GrantNav, please publish your data online and ensure it is listed  on the <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/">360Giving Data Registry</a> by the last working day of the month. </p>

<p>This update cycle is not affected by any requests to remove data listings from the Registry, or data from GrantNav. This process is separate and is detailed in the <a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/take_down_policy">Take Down Policy</a>.</p>

<p>When GrantNav is updated, the data included may change. There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>An organisation has updated its data to include more grants</li> 
<li>New organisations have published to the 360Giving Standard</li> 
<li>We have received a request from an organisation to take their data down – in these  cases, we follow our <a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/take_down_policy">Take Down Policy</a></li> 
<li>Data that was previously in GrantNav may no longer be available. For example, a link to a dataset may be broken because an organisation has updated its website and moved the location of the dataset.</li> 
</ul>

<p>In all these cases, 360Giving will work closely with the relevant organisations to get their data uploaded into GrantNav.</p>
